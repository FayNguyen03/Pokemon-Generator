# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Khanh Tra Nguyen Tran**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Choosing you Pokomon** is an android app that **randomly generates a Pokemon and returns the information about it or the user can choose their preferred Pokemon.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üëåü´°üêº**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/$id/** When the user wants the app to randomly generate a Pokemon for them then the application will random a number from 0 to 1000. But if the user has their preferred pokemon, we will use the query **https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/$name/**. 
- [X] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Pok√©mon API**.
